                        A DOG OR CAT</strong> </p>
                    </div>
                    <p><font size="2">By: Stanley Popovich</font></p>
                    <blockquote> 
                      <p>There are many advantages to adopting a dog or cat. Adopting 
                        a pet can be a great way to reduce our every day stresses 
                        and anxieties. In addition, there are many other reasons 
                        why adopting a dog or cat can be important in your life. 
                      </p>
                      <p>&nbsp; </p>
                      <p>For instance, pets can help us to relax and help us to 
                        focus on the good things in our lives. This can be very 
                        helpful when we are overwhelmed by the stresses and anxieties 
                        of our lives. Playing with our pets can help reduce our 
                        fears and anxieties in any situation.</p>
                      <p>&nbsp; </p>
                      <p>Pets can get our minds off of our problems. A person 
                        could do an activity with their pet or other animals that 
                        will give them a fresh perspective on things. Spending 
                        time with animals will get your mind off of the problem 
                        and give you the energy to do other things. Most importantly, 
                        playing with animals will give you the self-confidence 
                        that you can cope and that you can get through a stressful 
                        day.</p>
                      <p>&nbsp; </p>
                      <p>Spending time with a pet can reduce loneliness and can 
                        be a great source of companionship. A pet can help us 
                        to feel better. Also many people talk to their pets and 
                        this can help us to get their problems out in the open. 
                        Animals can be of good company to all of us and can prevent 
                        the fear of being alone during our troubles.</p>
                      <p>&nbsp; </p>
                      <p>Taking care of dog or cat can be a great way to increase 
                        our happiness and self-confidence. There are many animals 
                        out there who could benefit from your time and talents. 
                        Doing something that will help your pet or other animals 
                        can give you a source of pride and accomplishment. </p>
                      <p>&nbsp; </p>
                      <p>Pets are 100 percent faithful and will be by your side 
                        through the good and bad times. Everybody deals with anxieties, 
                        stresses and other life problems, and it is during those 
                        times when you need someone by your side to talk too. 
                        People in our lives come and go, but your pet will never 
                        leave you regardless how bad your problems may be. </p>
                      <p>&nbsp; </p>
                      <p>There are also many different breeds of dogs and cats 
                        we can choose from which can accommodate our life styles. 
                        If you want a certain type of pet that will suite your 
                        life style, all you have to do is talk to a pet expert 
                        or a veterinarian. These people will work with you to 
                        determine what type of dog to get that will fit in with 
                        your household.</p>
                      <p>&nbsp; </p>
                      <p>By adopting a pet, you will be saving a life; a life 
                        of an animal that could very well become your best friend. 
                        A pet will love you unconditionally during his or her 
                        lifetime. Don&#8217;t let a few obstacles prevent you 
                        from gaining a faithful companion in your life. Adopting 
                        a pet can be beneficial to your health and be one of the 
                        best things that you can do in your life. </p>

                    <blockquote> 
                      <p>Everybody deals with stress and anxiety, however some 
                        people sometimes take it out on their pets. Instead of 
                        taking your problems and frustrations out on your pets 
                        or other animals, here is a list of techniques that a 
                        person can use to help manage their stress, anxieties, 
                        and fears.</p>
                      <p>When facing a current or upcoming task that overwhelms 
                        you with anxiety, the first thing you can do is to break 
                        the task into a series of smaller steps. For example, 
                        changing careers can be a stressful situation. In order 
                        to help manage this task, try to divide this goal into 
                        a series of smaller steps and do each of these tasks one 
                        at a time. Completing these smaller tasks one at a time 
                        will make the stress more manageable and increases your 
                        chances of success. This is a lot more effective then 
                        taking your frustrations out on your pet.</p>
                      <p>Sometimes, we get stressed when everything happens all 
                        at once. Instead of taking it out on your dog or cat, 
                        a person should take a deep breathe and try to find something 
                        to do for a<br>
                        few minutes to get your mind off of the problem. A person 
                        could take a walk, listen to some music, read the newspaper 
                        or do an activity that will give them a fresh perspective 
                        on things. This mental timeout can help you refocus on 
                        your current situation.</p>
                      <p>In dealing with your anxieties, a person should learn 
                        to take it one day at a time. Instead of focusing on exaggerated 
                        assumptions that may or may not happen, focus on the present 
                        and take it one day at a time.</p>
                      <p>Sometimes, it helps to be able to talk to someone about 
                        our stressful situations. Talking to a trusted friend, 
                        counselor, or clergyman can not only make us feel better, 
                        but they might be able to give you additional advice and 
                        insights on how to deal with your current problem. This 
                        is a lot more effective than yelling at your dog or cat.</p>
                      <p>It is not easy to deal with our stressful problems, however 
                        taking our frustrations out on your pets or other people 
                        will not make the problem go away. When things are not 
                        going right, try to remember to treat your pet in the 
                        way you would want to be treated.</p>
