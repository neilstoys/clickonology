        <h3>SEO (Search Engine Optimization)</h3>
        <p>SEO is an acronym for "search engine optimization" or "search engine optimizer" and is a methodology for strategies and techniques to encourage visitors to your website. In a search results page of any search engine (SERP), it is possible to obtain a high-ranking placement.<br>
            The higher a website ranks in organic (paid pages not included) results of a users search, the greater the chance that that site will be clicked on by that user. (i.e. a user generally doesn't click on link on page 94 of his search to visit a website.) <br>
So ideally when a search is initiated, you need your website listed at the top of page one!<p>
            
        <h3>Marketing</h3>
        <p>Content Marketing is offered by consistently creating valuable and relevant industry related information to provide an audience and develop a loyal customer base.<br>
Social Media Marketing is becoming more prevalent. Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter, Pinterest, Google+, Tumblr and Instagram are all pushing the boundaries of diverse media. It's another angle to help your business lead the field.</p>
